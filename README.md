# PyGame 3D Engine
3D Rendering Engine created using PyGame

I made this as a project for one of my Computer Science classes in High School, if you have a sensitive stomach avert your gaze now.

It runs fairly* decently being that it's written in Python.

*Fairly meaning it can handle rendering about 15-20ish polygons before the FPS drops
